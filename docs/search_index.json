Do these high death rate jobs have any features in common? 1.2 The relationship between the mortality of occupations and the income For example: If one person is doing the dangerous job, will he get paid higher? 1.3 The relationship between mortality of occupations and education level For example: If one job has a higher requirement education level, will this job be less dangerous?

And death numbers are low in intellectual work such as law, IT and education. The top 2 causes of death are Transportation accidents and Falls, slips, trips The least cause of death is Fires and explosions Here we go deeper in transportation group. we can conclude that truck drivers have relatively high death number within this category. 5.1.2 Classify by detailed occupations The occupation with the highest morality rate is “Farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers”, the second is “Fallers”. 5.1.2.1 Typical requirement needed to entry these 2 occupations ## # A tibble: 3 × 2 ## Entry_Standard Entry_requireme… ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Typical education needed for entry High school dip… ## 2 Work experience in a related occupation 5 years or more ## 3 Typical on-the-job training needed to attain competency in t… None The entry requirement for Famers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers ## # A tibble: 3 × 2 ## Entry_Standard Entry_requireme… ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Typical education needed for entry High school dip… ## 2 Work experience in a related occupation None ## 3 Typical on-the-job training needed to attain competency in t… Moderate-term o… The entry requirement for Fallers The Typical requirements needed to entry these 2 occupations are pretty similar. 5.1.3 Top 10 mortality rate occupations ## # A tibble: 10 × 2 ## Rank occupation ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 Farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers ## 2 2 Fallers ## 3 3 Tree trimmers and pruners ## 4 4 Commercial divers ## 5 5 Supervisors of farming, fishing, and forestry workers ## 6 6 First-line supervisors of farming, fishing, and forestry workers ## 7 7 Farmworkers, farm, ranch, and aquacultural animals ## 8 8 Athletes and sports competitors ## 9 9 Commercial pilots ## 10 10 Logging workers Among these 10 occupations, 4 of them are related to “farm” and 3 of them are related to “logging”. 5.1.3.1 Education level distributions of of employees of these occupations There are 2 NAs among these 10 occupations’ education level distributions: Supervisors of farming, fishing, and forestry workers and Logging workers After drop_na(), we have 8 occupations here. From the plot we can tell that the education level distributions of these 8 occupations are similar. All distributions are right-skewed, which means most of the employees are less educated 5.2 Is there any relationship between mortality and average salary? Does one get paid higher if he is doing dangerous jobs? From this plot we can tell that there is no significant relationship between mortality and median annual income. Doing dangerous job can’t significantly increase the income. 5.3 Is there any relationship between mortality and education level? If a job has higher requirement of education level, will it be less dangerous? The overall trend is the higher the education level needed for entry, the lower the median mortality rate. Associate degree should be an outlier because it only has one row of data. 5.4 The relationship between annual income and education lelvel needed for entry Since income data is right-skewed, using the mean may falsely exaggerate income. Here we use median income as a measure. From the plot we can tell that the higher the education level needed for entry, the higher the median annual income. Income is positively correlated with education level needed for entry.

If a job has higher requirement of education level, will it be less dangerous? 7.4 Then what factors affect the income of a job?", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 What jobs have a significantly high death rate, do they have any features in common? By major occupation groups, that death numbers are high in manual work such as transportation, construction and maintenance. And death numbers are low in intellectual work such as law, IT and education. By detailed occupations, the occupation with the highest morality is “Farmers, ranchers, and other agricultural managers”, the second is “Fallers”. In conclusion, manual work has higher mortality rate, intellectual work has lower mortality rate. Besides, the lower the education level needed for entry, the higher the mortality rate. And among manual jobs, those related to nature, farm or logging have the highest mortality rate. 7.2 Is there any relationship between mortality and average salary? Does one get paid higher if he is doing dangerous jobs? No, there is no clear relationship between mortality rate and average salary. Doing dangerous job can’t significantly increase the income. 7.3 Is there any relationship between mortality and education level? If a job has higher requirement of education level, will it be less dangerous? Yes, mortality rate is negatively correlated with typical education needed for entry. The higher the typical education needed for entry, the lower the mortality rate. 7.4 Then what factors affect the income of a job? Based on our data sets, the answer is education level. The higher the education level needed for entry, the higher the median annual income of this job. Income is positively correlated with education level needed for entry.
